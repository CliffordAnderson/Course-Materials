#XQuery Summer Institute

#Installation Workshop

##oXygen
The oXygen XML Editor is a leading integrated development environment (IDE) for XML, XQuery, XSLT and other XML-based standards. We'll be using oXygen as our primary editing and programming environment.

If you do not already have oXygen installed, we have a classroom license you can use during your time at the Institute. Please email [Ed Warga](mailto:ed.warga@vanderbilt.edu) for a copy of the license key. To use the classroom key, [download](http://oxygenxml.com/download_oxygenxml_editor.html) and install oXygen Editor. Run the program, and input the key you received when prompted.


##eXist-db
eXist-db is an open source XML Database. We'll be using eXist-db as to store, query, and analyze XML documents using XQuery.

Download the eXist-db .jar file. Information about it is here: [http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/homepage/index.html#downloads.](http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/homepage/index.html#downloads) (Note this page provides a link to take you to http://sourceforge.net for the latest version of eXist-db)

The following links lead to information for installing and configuring eXist for use during the Institute.

##GitHub
GitHub is a social network for coders. We'll be using GitHub to host and share our code during the course.

### Getting Started
* If you do not already have a GitHub account, create one at [github.com](https://github.com/).
* [Set Up](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-windows) - you can install the GitHub app for an easy to use GUI experience, or the Git command line utility.
* [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/categories/54/articles) - visit the help page for more details about getting started and list of [resources](https://help.github.com/articles/what-are-other-good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github) to help you use GitHub.

### Gist
Gist is a simple way to share snippets and pastes with others. All gists are Git repositories, so they are automatically versioned, forkable and usable from Git. Get started at [https://gist.github.com/](https://gist.github.com/)

### Course Materials
The XQuery Summer Institute course materials are available in [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/XQueryInstitute/Course-Materials).

##Folger Digital Edition

We will be exploring the recently released corpus of Shakespeare texts in TEI/XML from the [Folger Shakespeare Library](https://www.folger.edu/). The [Folger Digital Texts](http://www.folgerdigitaltexts.org/) are released under a [CC-BY-NC license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/deed.en_US). The XML encoded texts are available for [download](http://www.folgerdigitaltexts.org/downloadsourcecode.html) from the Library's site. They are also available from the [Institute's GitHub repository](https://github.com/XQueryInstitute/Course-Materials/tree/master/folger%20shakespeare%20texts).

Once you have installed and configured eXist-db and oXygen XML Editor, you can upload the Folger Shakespeare Library texts to your eXist database. The links under the exist-db header above will help in this task.
