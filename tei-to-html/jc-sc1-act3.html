            <h1>Scene 3</h1>/ <b>Stage direction: </b><i>Stage direction: Thunder and lightning.
                Stage direction: Enter Casca and Cicero.</i>/ / <p><b>CICERO: </b>/ Good even,
                Casca. Brought you Caesar home?/ Why are you breathless? And why stare you so?</p>/
                    <p><b>CASCA: </b>/ Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth/ Shakes like a
                thing unfirm? O Cicero,/ I have seen tempests when the scolding winds/ Have rived
                the knotty oaks, and I have seen/ Th’ ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam/ To be
                exalted with the threat’ning clouds;/ But never till tonight, never till now,/ Did I
                go through a tempest dropping fire./ Either there is a civil strife in heaven,/ Or
                else the world, too saucy with the gods,/ Incenses them to send destruction.</p>/
                    <p><b>CICERO: </b>/ Why, saw you anything more wonderful?</p>/ <p><b>CASCA:
                </b>/ A common slave (you know him well by sight)/ Held up his left hand, which did
                flame and burn/ Like twenty torches joined; and yet his hand,/ Not sensible of fire,
                remained unscorched./ Besides (I ha’ not since put up my sword),/ Against the
                Capitol I met a lion,/ Who glazed upon me and went surly by/ Without annoying me.
                And there were drawn/ Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,/ Transformèd with their
                fear, who swore they saw/ Men all in fire walk up and down the streets./ And
                yesterday the bird of night did sit/ Even at noonday upon the marketplace,/ Hooting
                and shrieking. When these prodigies/ Do so conjointly meet, let not men say/ These
                are their reasons, they are natural,/ For I believe they are portentous things/ Unto
                the climate that they point upon.</p>/ <p><b>CICERO: </b>/ Indeed, it is a
                strange-disposèd time./ But men may construe things after their fashion,/ Clean from
                the purpose of the things themselves./ Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?</p>/
                    <p><b>CASCA: </b>/ He doth, for he did bid Antonius/ Send word to you he would
                be there tomorrow.</p>/ <p><b>CICERO: </b>/ Good night then, Casca. This disturbèd
                sky/ Is not to walk in.</p>/ <p><b>CASCA: </b>Farewell, Cicero</p><b>Stage
                direction: </b><i>Cicero exits.</i>/ / <b>Stage direction: </b><i>Enter
            Cassius.</i>/ / <p><b>CASSIUS: </b>Who’s there?</p>/ <p><b>CASCA: </b>A Roman.</p>/
                    <p><b>CASSIUS: </b>Casca, by your voice.</p>/ <p><b>CASCA: </b>/ Your ear is
                good. Cassius, what night is this!</p>/ <p><b>CASSIUS: </b>/ A very pleasing night
                to honest men.</p>/ <p><b>CASCA: </b>/ Who ever knew the heavens menace so?</p>/
                    <p><b>CASSIUS: </b>/ Those that have known the earth so full of faults./ For my
                part, I have walked about the streets,/ Submitting me unto the perilous night,/ And
                thus unbracèd, Casca, as you see,/ Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;/ And
                when the cross blue lightning seemed to open/ The breast of heaven, I did present
                myself/ Even in the aim and very flash of it.</p>/ <p><b>CASCA: </b>/ But wherefore
                did you so much tempt the heavens?/ It is the part of men to fear and tremble/ When
                the most mighty gods by tokens send/ Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.</p>/
                    <p><b>CASSIUS: </b>/ You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life/ That should
                be in a Roman you do want,/ Or else you use not. You look pale, and gaze,/ And put
                on fear, and cast yourself in wonder,/ To see the strange impatience of the
                heavens./ But if you would consider the true cause/ Why all these fires, why all
                these gliding ghosts,/ Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,/ Why old men,
                fools, and children calculate,/ Why all these things change from their ordinance,/
                Their natures, and preformèd faculties,/ To monstrous quality—why, you shall find/
                That heaven hath infused them with these spirits/ To make them instruments of fear
                and warning/ Unto some monstrous state./ Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man/
                Most like this dreadful night,/ That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars/ As
                doth the lion in the Capitol;/ A man no mightier than thyself or me/ In personal
                action, yet prodigious grown,/ And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.</p>/
                    <p><b>CASCA: </b>/ ’Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?</p>/
                    <p><b>CASSIUS: </b>/ Let it be who it is. For Romans now/ Have thews and limbs
                like to their ancestors./ But, woe the while, our fathers’ minds are dead,/ And we
                are governed with our mothers’ spirits./ Our yoke and sufferance show us
                womanish.</p>/ <p><b>CASCA: </b>/ Indeed, they say the Senators tomorrow/ Mean to
                establish Caesar as a king,/ And he shall wear his crown by sea and land/ In every
                place save here in Italy.</p>/ <p><b>CASSIUS: </b>/ I know where I will wear this
                dagger then;/ Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius./ Therein, you gods, you
                make the weak most strong;/ Therein, you gods, you tyrants do defeat./ Nor stony
                tower, nor walls of beaten brass,/ Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,/
                Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;/ But life, being weary of these worldly
                bars,/ Never lacks power to dismiss itself./ If I know this, know all the world
                besides,/ That part of tyranny that I do bear/ I can shake off at
                pleasure.</p><b>Stage direction: </b><i>Thunder still.</i>/ <p><b>CASCA: </b>So can
                I./ So every bondman in his own hand bears/ The power to cancel his captivity.</p>/
                    <p><b>CASSIUS: </b>/ And why should Caesar be a tyrant, then?/ Poor man, I know
                he would not be a wolf/ But that he sees the Romans are but sheep;/ He were no lion,
                were not Romans hinds./ Those that with haste will make a mighty fire/ Begin it with
                weak straws. What trash is Rome,/ What rubbish, and what offal when it serves/ For
                the base matter to illuminate/ So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,/ Where hast
                thou led me? I perhaps speak this/ Before a willing bondman; then, I know/ My answer
                must be made. But I am armed,/ And dangers are to me indifferent.</p>/ <p><b>CASCA:
                </b>/ You speak to Casca, and to such a man/ That is no fleering telltale. Hold. My
                hand./ <b>Stage direction: </b><i>They shake hands.</i>/ Be factious for redress of
                all these griefs,/ And I will set this foot of mine as far/ As who goes
                farthest.</p>/ <p><b>CASSIUS: </b>There’s a bargain made./ Now know you, Casca, I
                have moved already/ Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans/ To undergo with me an
                enterprise/ Of honorable-dangerous consequence./ And I do know by this they stay for
                me/ In Pompey’s Porch. For now, this fearful night,/ There is no stir or walking in
                the streets;/ And the complexion of the element/ In favor ’s like the work we have
                in hand,/ Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.</p>/ / <b>Stage direction:
                </b><i>Enter Cinna.</i>/ / <p><b>CASCA: </b>/ Stand close awhile, for here comes one
                in haste.</p>/ <p><b>CASSIUS: </b>/ ’Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait./ He is a
                friend.—Cinna, where haste you so?</p>/ <p><b>CINNA: </b>/ To find out you. Who’s
                that? Metellus Cimber?</p>/ <p><b>CASSIUS: </b>/ No, it is Casca, one incorporate/
                To our attempts. Am I not stayed for, Cinna?</p>/ <p><b>CINNA: </b>/ I am glad on
                ’t. What a fearful night is this!/ There’s two or three of us have seen strange
                sights.</p>/ <p><b>CASSIUS: </b>Am I not stayed for? Tell me.</p>/ <p><b>CINNA:
                </b>/ Yes, you are. O Cassius, if you could/ But win the noble Brutus to our
                party—</p>/ <p><b>CASSIUS: </b><b>Stage direction: </b><i>, handing him papers</i>/
                Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,/ And look you lay it in the Praetor’s
                chair,/ Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this/ In at his window; set this up
                with wax/ Upon old Brutus’ statue. All this done,/ Repair to Pompey’s Porch, where
                you shall find us./ Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?</p>/ <p><b>CINNA: </b>/
                All but Metellus Cimber, and he’s gone/ To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie/
                And so bestow these papers as you bade me.</p>/ <p><b>CASSIUS: </b>/ That done,
                repair to Pompey’s Theater./ <b>Stage direction: </b><i>Cinna exits.</i>/ Come,
                Casca, you and I will yet ere day/ See Brutus at his house. Three parts of him/ Is
                ours already, and the man entire/ Upon the next encounter yields him ours.</p>/
                    <p><b>CASCA: </b>/ O, he sits high in all the people’s hearts,/ And that which
                would appear offense in us/ His countenance, like richest alchemy,/ Will change to
                virtue and to worthiness.</p>/ <p><b>CASSIUS: </b>/ Him and his worth and our great
                need of him/ You have right well conceited. Let us go,/ For it is after midnight,
                and ere day/ We will awake him and be sure of him.</p>/ <b>Stage direction:
                </b><i>They exit.</i>
